# Real or AI? - The Game

## Overview

"Real or AI?" is an interactive web-based game that tests your ability to distinguish between real photographs and images generated by artificial intelligence. As AI image generation technology becomes more sophisticated, it's getting harder to tell the difference. This project puts your perception to the test!

The game presents you with a series of images, and you have to decide: is it a real photo or an AI creation? You'll get instant feedback on your choice and a running score to track your progress.

## Features

- **Engaging Gameplay**: A simple yet addictive game loop that's easy to pick up and play.
- **Image Variety**: A diverse set of images from different categories to keep the challenge fresh.
- **Scoring and Streaks**: Track your score and see how many correct guesses you can get in a row.
- **Responsive Design**: Play on your desktop or mobile device.
- **Keyboard and Swipe Controls**: Use arrow keys on desktop or swipe gestures on mobile for quick gameplay.
