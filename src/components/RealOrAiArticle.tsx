      <p>We used to think we could trust what we see.<br />Now, we're not so sure.</p>

      <p>It's getting harder to tell the difference between what's real and what's generated.<br />
      Images, videos, whole realities — spun up by algorithms faster than we can blink.</p>

      <p>Some of it is beautiful.<br />
      Some of it is terrifying.<br />
      Most of it sits somewhere in between.</p>

      <p>As Alkemist — two people and a dog, figuring it out like everyone else — we feel this shift every day.<br />
      AI has cracked open our creative process in ways we never imagined.</p>

      <p>It lets us dream faster, build weirder, test ideas we might not have dared on our own.<br />
      It's fun. It's addictive.<br />
      It's changing how we work, and what we expect from ourselves.</p>

      <p>But it's not all wonder.<br />
      There's a real risk too.</p>

      <p>When everything can look real,<br />
      when every voice can be cloned,<br />
      every moment faked —<br />
      what happens to trust?<br />
      What happens to truth?</p>

      <p>We don't really have answers.<br />
      Some days we're amazed by what's possible.<br />
      Other days we're uneasy about where it might be taking us.</p>

      <p>Maybe staying in that tension —<br />
      staying curious, even uncomfortable —<br />
      is the point.</p>

      <p>We're releasing <a href="https://real-or-ai-game.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Real or AI?</a> right now — a small project we made to see if we could still tell the difference ourselves.<br />
      Mostly, it raises more questions than answers.<br />
      But maybe that's a good place to start too.</p>

      <p>After all, the future was never going to build itself.<br />
      We're all in it now — two people, a dog, some questionable algorithms — trying to make something a little better than what we found.</p>
